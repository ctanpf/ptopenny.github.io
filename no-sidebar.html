									<h2>Experience</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									<h4>

									</h4>
										<p>
											<i>I helped them to:</i>
											<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
												<li>Developed a GUI with gtk-Perl that helped to push out packages to the engineers for testing and system upgrade purposes</li>
												<li>Wrote Python, Perl, and Shell script for testing and debugging purposes</li>
											</ul>
										</p>
										<br>
									<h4>
										Student Tech Assistant at <b><i>Center of Education and Innovation</i></b>
									</h4>
										<p>
											<i>I assisted them to:</i>
											<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
												<li>Updated and edited faculty's website and worked extensively with HTML and CSS</li>

										<p> Python, Java, C, HTML, CSS</p>
										<h4> Familiar with: </h4>
										<p> Javascript, Perl, Shell, Android Development</p>
										<h4>Tools: </h4>
										<p> Android Studio, Eclipse, Perforce, Git, AngularJS</p>
									</p>

									<p>
										I'm currently learning Javascript and some libraries. Building this website has brought me into JS world and I'm really fascinated with this language. AngularJS and jQuery are two of the things that I really want to dive in. So stay tuned on my website's project page!
									</p>
									
									<h2>Leadership</h2>
									<p>
										<h4> Leader of High School Robotic Team </h4>
										<p>
											<i>I have</i>
											<ul style = "list-style-type:disc">
												<li> Lead the school robotic team to compete at the state level robotic competition that is organized by Lego and the Ministry of Education, Malaysia</li>
												<li> Lead the programming and builder team to come out with a robot prototype and programming algorithms</li>
											</ul>
											<p> My programming interest is started by this competition. Seeing your own robot to move on the competition stage with the code I wrote is probably one of the happiest moment in my life. This explained why am I studying Computer Engineering now.
											</p>

									<p>
										<h4> Vice Organizing Chairperson of AUP Sport Fiesta 2014</h4>
										<p>
											<i>I have</i>
											<ul style = "list-style-type:disc">
												<li> Oversaw a committee with more than 50 peoples and moderate the work flow of the event</li>
												<li> Obtained a sponsorship from Gatorade and generated a revenue of $2500</li>
												<li>Awarded the best sport event of the year by the student government</li>
											</ul>
											<p> This is one of the highest ranking position I ever sit throughout my committee year in my previous college. This is one of the biggest event I've ever handle the scale is unprecendented large. Shoutout to my Organizing Chairperson and one of my Vice Organizing Chairperson for supporting each other and making this event so successful.
											</p>

										</p>

									<p>
										<h4> Program Master of AUP Halloween Night 2013</h4>
										<p>
											<i>I have</i>
											<ul style = "list-style-type:disc">
												<li> Worked with all department to come up with a theme and planned events, props, and costumes that are needed</li>
												<li> Coordinated the event flow on that event night</li>
											</ul>
											<p> This event is really interesting because we are working on a haunted house event. We actually built the whole thing in a creepy corridor of my college student union. We are lucky enough to get enough budget from the treasurer and we built most of the scene from scratch with just plywood, paper, and desk. This is the most exhausting event and I spent most of my night searching for creepy music for the haunted house. To get more inspiration, I actually watch The Conjuring, The Sinister, and some other classic horror movie by my own in my dorm. 10/10 will do it again

									<p> <i> You guys might be wondering what is this AUP thingy?</i></p>
									<p> AUP is an acronym for American University Program which is an academic program which students spend their freshman and sophomore year at Malaysia. We still take courses like Calculus, History, Physics and Biology classes. We later transfer all the credits to the US college and finish our Bachelor degree in the US.</p>
